Social networks such as Facebook are full of a rich set of user preferences (likes of links, posts, photos, videos) and user traits and interactions (conversation streams, tagging, group memberships, personal history and demographic data). However, what interactions or common traits among friends are actually reflective of their common preferences as expressed by their likes? In this work, we evaluate these questions using a data set of over 100 Facebook users and their complete interactions with a combined set of almost 37,000 friends over a four month study period. Our analysis shows a large variation in the way different user interactions and traits are reflected in common interests and based on this we conclude with a discussion of the underlying social phenomena that appear to contribute to these variations.
