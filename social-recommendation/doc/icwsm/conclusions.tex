In concluding our evaluation in this paper, we 
confirmed many previous observations of related work: saturation
effects~\cite{Romero2011hashtag}, the importance of directionality of
interactions~\cite{saez2011high}, and the importance of real
vs. virtual interactions~\cite{brandtzag2011facebook}.  This work also
elucidated some fascinating new insights.  For one, 
saturation effects in exposure curves have been noted
by~\cite{Romero2011hashtag} to be topic-dependent --- in this work
we note that they are \emph{also} social 
\emph{interaction-dependent}.  Secondly, certain interactions are
highly predictive of certain \textit{Like Types} and certain specific
\emph{Interaction Directions}, \emph{Modalitities}, and \emph{Actions}
are far more predictive of general likes (i.e., outgoing photo likes)
than others.  Finally, common user traits such as \emph{Interests} and
\emph{History} display interesting and unusual trends w.r.t.\ exposure
and group size that indicate different social mechanisms may be at
work behind some of these traits --- an important topic for future
exploration.

Perhaps most importantly though, comparing the overall predictiveness
of user social \textit{Interactions} vs. user traits such as
\textit{Demographics} or \textit{Interests} and \textit{History}, we
note that in general, the most predictive (and statistically
significant) \emph{social interactions far outperformed any of the
user traits} thus indicating that social groups defined by
interactions may form the strongest features from which to form
predictors for preferences in a social setting.  In conclusion, this
offers perhaps the most important distinguishing characteristic for
the initial questions that motivated this paper.
