%              Romero2011hashtag exposure curve -- we find a new
%              mechanism for reducing persistence

In the following sections, we subdivide our analysis of $P(u \mbox{
likes } i | i \in L_{G,C})$ according to three dimensions: social
interaction properties, interest and history user traits, and user
demographic data.  All restrictions on $L$,$G$, and $C$ referenced
below have been defined in Section~\ref{sec:methodology}.  

\subsection{Predictiveness of Interactions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Figure~\ref{fig:res2}, we plot the exposure curves for 
all liked items w.r.t.\ different \textit{Interaction Actions},
\textit{Interaction Modalities}, and
\textit{Interaction Directionality}.  A few important points
are worth noting:
\begin{itemize}
\item As in~\cite{Romero2011hashtag}, we note a saturation
effect as the number of a times an item has been liked
increases, i.e., the curves often peak around 6--8 interactions
then fall off.  
While Romero {\it et al} noted that the
peak of the saturation curve was \emph{topic-dependent}, as a novel
observation we note that the peak is \emph{interaction-dependent}.
Indeed, one can clearly see that when defining groups according
to post interactions (of any directionality), the exposure
curve peaks much earlier than the baseline friends group
exposure curve.  One possible explanation for this is that
post interactions increase exposure to content on a friend's
wall (which are not explicitly recorded as likes) and these
implicit unrecorded exposures thereby lead to a perceived
earlier peak as a function of explicit like exposures.
\item As noted by previous work~\cite{saez2011high}, interaction
direction is highly reflective of preferences.  In general,
the interaction groups with the highest overlap of likes
are the \textit{outgoing} interaction groups --- this makes
perfect sense in a social network setting --- one may tend
to like the same things as the people one is most likely
to initiate an interaction with.
\item For this Facebook data, we note that the specific
interactions with highest predictiveness (both by
statistical signficance and the maximum probability)
are \emph{outgoing post tags}, \emph{outgoing photo likes},
\emph{outgoing post likes}, and \emph{outgoing video comments}.
We hypothesize that video comments are more predictive than
other comments since watching a video (in order to comment on it)
indicates a much higher level of interest in a user than other
commenting interactions (link, post, and photo).
\end{itemize}

% - saturation effect, exposure curve
% - earlier saturation for post interactions (*new modality for 
%   reducing persistence -- more exposures b/c interacting on 
%   user's wall)
% - highest / most significant -- outgoing post tags, photo likes, post likes, video comments -- watch

In Figure~\ref{fig:res3}, we plot the exposure curves for 
different \textit{Like Types} 
 w.r.t.\ different \textit{Interaction Actions} and
\textit{Interaction Directionality}.  A few important points
are worth noting:
\begin{itemize}
\item For this Facebook data, we note that the specific interactions
with highest predictiveness (both by statistical signficance and the
maximum probability) invariant of the \textit{Like Type} is simply
\emph{outgoing likes}; this seems quite reasonable: users are
likely to like any item liked by users who have posted items they have
liked previously.
\item While all \emph{outgoing interactions} do not predict \emph{post
likes} and \emph{link likes} well, all \emph{outgoing interactions}
appear to predict \emph{photo likes} and \emph{video likes} well.
\end{itemize}
% - all outgoing likes predictive of likes for each individual type
% - outgoing comments mainly predictive for photos and video
% - co-posting groups saturate early

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We evaluate in Figure~\ref{fig:res4} which of \emph{incoming} or
\emph{outgoing}, \emph{real} or \emph{virtual} interactions are most
predictive of a user's likes.  In short, while incoming interactions
do not show either real or virtual interacting friends 
to be more predictive of likes than general friends, there is
a stronger trend (although not statistically significant for
any single data point) that \emph{outgoing} interactions for 
\emph{real} friends are more predictive of preferences
than for friends and virtual friends in general.
