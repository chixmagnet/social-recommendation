To my family, who gave a 10 year old kid a 286 IBM PC running DOS back when the only use I could think for it was listing down all my favorite Dragon Ball Z characters on WordStar. The good old days when men were men and floppy disks were actually floppy. And for hooking me up to the internet 3 years later, when no one else I knew was on it, and all I did on it for months was to study deck strategies for Magic: The Gathering. I have my passion, my career, and my future only though the unbelievable foresight you guys had.
