First of all, thanks to my adviser, Scott Sanner. For introducing a newbie like me to the world of research, for having god-like omniscience when answering all my questions, for being the best adviser a student could ever have, and for being a friend. I may have already gone through all the good karma I'll ever have in academia by having him as my adviser on two projects for the past year and a half.

These thesis also wouldn't be possible without the rest of the Facebook LinkR Research Group. Thanks to Khoi-Nguyen Tran for being understanding after I crashed his LinkR server with 8GB of RAM on two consecutive nights running my experiments, and to Peter Christen, Lexing Xie, Edwin Bonilla and Ehsan Abbasnejad who all gave valuable inputs on which directions these thesis should go.

Thanks my family back home, who pushed me to go back to school and get my Masters degree even when I didn't want to. I eventually found myself enjoying it so much that I stayed another year. All this was possible only with their love and support. 

Finally, to Aurora, who surprised me by coming to Australia the past week and gave me enough strength to finish this. Thank you for everything.
