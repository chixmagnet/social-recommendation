Given the vast amount of content available on the Internet, finding
information of personal interest (news, blogs, videos, movies, books,
etc.) is often like finding a needle in a haystack.  Recommender
systems based on \emph{collaborative filtering}
(CF)~\cite{collab_filtering} aim to address this problem by leveraging
the preferences of a user population under the assumption that similar
users will have similar preferences.
%These principles underlie the
%recommendation algorithms powering websites like Amazon and
%Netflix.\footnote{On Amazon, this is directly evident with statements
%displayed of the form ``users who looked at item X ended up purchasing
%item Y 90\% of the time''.  While the exact inner workings of Netflix
%are not published, the best performing recommendation algorithm in
%the popular Netflix prize competition~\cite{netflix} 
%used an ensemble of CF methods.}

As the web has become more social with the emergence of Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and most recently Google+, this adds myriad new
dimensions to the recommendation problem by making available a rich
labeled graph structure of social content from which user preferences
can be learned and new recommendations can be made.  In this socially
connected setting, no longer are web users simply described by an IP
address (with perhaps associated geographical information and browsing
history), but rather they are described by a rich user profile (age,
gender, location, educational and work history, preferences, etc.)
and a rich history of user interactions with their friends (comments/posts, 
clicks of the like button, tagging in photos, mutual group
memberships, etc.).  This rich information poses both an amazing
opportunity and a daunting challenge for machine learning methods
applied to social recommendation --- how do we fully exploit rich social
network content in recommendation algorithms?

Many existing \emph{social CF} (SCF)
approaches~\cite{ste,sorec,lla,socinf,sr,rrmf} extend \emph{matrix
factorization} (MF) techniques such as~\cite{pmf} used in the
non-social CF setting.  These MF approaches have proved quite powerful
and indeed, we will show empirically in Section~\ref{sec:EmpResults} 
that existing social extensions of MF outperform a variety of other
non-MF SCF baselines.  The power of CF MF methods stems from their
ability to project users and items into latent vector spaces of
reduced dimensionality where each is effectively grouped by
similarity; in turn, the power of many of the SCF MF extensions stems
from their ability to use social network evidence to further constrain
(or regularize) latent user projections.

Given the strong performance of existing MF approaches to SCF, we aim
to further improve on their performance in this paper.  To do this, we
have first identified a number of major deficiencies of existing SCF MF
objective functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] {\bf Feature-based user similarity learning:} Existing SCF
MF objectives do not fully exploit user features when learning user
similarity based on observed interactions.  For example, one might 
enforce that two users are similar when their gender matches, but
existing SCF MF objectives do not allow \emph{learning} such a
property in cases where the data supports it.
% Note: potential for latent item information diffusion here
\item[(b)] {\bf Direct learning of user-to-user information
diffusion:} Existing SCF MF objectives do not permit directly modeling
user-to-user information diffusion according to the social graph
structure.  For example, if a certain user \emph{always} likes content
liked by a friend, this cannot be directly \emph{learned}
by optimizing existing SCF MF objectives.
\item[(c)] {\bf Learning restricted interests:} Existing SCF MF
objectives treat users as globally (dis)similar although they may only
be (dis)similar in specific latent areas of interest.  For example, a
friend and their co-worker may both like technology-oriented news
content, but have differing interests when it comes to
politically-oriented news content.  Existing SCF MF objective
functions do not leverage \emph{co-preference 
(dis)agreement} (i.e., whether two users agreed or disagreed in their
rating of the \emph{same} item) to encourage \emph{learning} restricted
latent areas where two users are (dis)similar.
\end{enumerate}

This paper addresses (a)--(c) by proposing novel objective functions
in a unified latent factorization framework for SCF.  We present
results of our proposed recommendation algorithms in online human
trials of a custom-developed Facebook App for link recommendation that
involves data collected over three months from over 100 active App
users and their 34,000+ friends.  These results show that the
extensions proposed to resolve (a)--(c) outperform a wide range of
previously existing SCF algorithms.

To this end, the remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Section~\ref{sec:Background} -- Definitions and Background:} 
We define mathematical notation used throughout the paper along
with a discussion of related work and all baseline comparison methods
we use in this paper.
\item {\bf Section~\ref{sec:NewObjFuns} -- New Objective Functions for
SCF:} We propose novel extensions to address (a)--(c) within a unified
mathematical framework.  Gradients for optimizing these functions
are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:Derivatives}.
\item {\bf Section~\ref{sec:Evaluation} -- Evaluation Framework:} We
discuss the details of our Facebook App for link
recommendation as well as our evaluation methodology for 
online (live user trial) experimentation.  
\item {\bf Section~\ref{sec:EmpResults} -- Empirical Results:} In our
first online trial, we identify an MF-based SCF method as the
best-performing baseline algorithm.  This directly motivated our
decision to extend MF-based methods in Section~\ref{sec:NewObjFuns}
and hence we compare these new objectives to the best-performing SCF
MF baseline from the first trial.  After showing where each extension
improves on the baseline, we propose a number of additional
experiments to better understand trends and patterns in our social
recommendation setting such as the use of explicit like/dislike
feedback vs. link click information, the impact of textual link
context, and the relationship between like
popularity and user preference.
%, and importantly, why Steve Jobs
%passing almost ruined our second trial results and what insight we can
%gain from such extreme events.
\item {\bf Section~\ref{sec:Conclusions} -- Conclusions:} We summarize
our conclusions from the empirical evaluations and outline 
future research directions stemming from the current work.
% NOTE: one possible conclusion: beware of using passive evaluation 
%       metrics with inferred false labels.
\end{itemize}

All combined, this paper represents a critical step forward in
powerful SCF recommendation algorithms based on latent factorization
methods and their ability to fully exploit the breadth of information
available on social networks.
